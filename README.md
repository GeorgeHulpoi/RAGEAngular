# RAGE Angular

Hi, my name is Armyw0w, I made this Module to integrate Angular in RAGE Multiplayer (for the CEF more exactly)

## Installation

You need NodeJS installed (You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org))
> npm install rage-angular@latest

## Import module

I hope you know to import the module, if not, you should take a look [here](https://angular.io/guide/ngmodule)

##### IMPORTANT!
If you don't import the RAGE in a component the RAGEInit() callback it will never be called.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Armyw0w/RAGEAngular/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
